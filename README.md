# tgv-prototype

A prototype application to support TGV bid

## Overview

The project consists of several parts

- a set of utilities to get OCR data and related metadata from a variety of holding libraries (in `fetcher/`)
- an instance of the Typesense instant search service (`docker/Dockerfile.typesense`)
- a single entry point that retrieves data from remote resources, gathers it into a large JSONL file, and inserts it into Typesense (`fetcher/fetcher.py`)
- a demo frontend against the application API  (`frontend/`)

It is supported by a number of utility functions (`fetcher/utils.py`)

Most functionality in the Python scripts can be used either as a module or from the command-line.

It is accompanied by files which specify a containerised application, split over `./compose.yml` and the Dockerfiles in `docker/`.

### Data and metadata retrieval 

Supported sources

- anno.onb.ac.at (`anno.py`)
- api.digitale-sammlungen.de (`mdz.py`)
- iiif.onb.ac.at/ABO (`abo.py`)

We also support gathering `digitale-sammlungen.de` item IDs from the BSB calendar pages (e.g. https://digipress.digitale-sammlungen.de/calendar/newspaper/bsbmult00000129). This functionality is in `bsb.py` and produces item IDs that can be used with the `mdz.py` script. It is currently not working correctly.

`fetcher/fetcher.py` takes the `.txt` files produced by each of these retrievers and produces a single newline delimited JSON file, which can be then loaded into the search backend.

We used `requests_cache` during development to help reduce the number of requests to remote servers. 

`fetcher/fetcher.py` supports a number of command-line flags, which can be used to skip key steps in the data ingestion process.

### Search backend

Requires a working installation of Typesense. A `compose.yml` to use with e.g. Docker Compose is provided for convenience.

`insert.py` deletes any existing Typesense collection, creates a new one, and inserts the documents from the JSON file into the search backend.

### Search frontend

I include a very simple demonstration (thanks to Copilot for Business) of how Typesense integration might look on the frontend. We certainly want to use snippets/highlighted "hits", [which Typesense supports](https://typesense.org/docs/27.1/api/search.html#results-parameters:~:text=wasted%20CPU%20cycles.-,highlight_fields,-no).

## Usage

### Install/Setup

0. Create a `.env` file (see samples below)
1. Run `docker-compose up` from the root of the project directory
2. Visit application at localhost:8100

### Development 

Some useful commands

- `docker-compose build --no-cache [SERVICE_NAME]` to rebuild images from scratch

It is important to keep track of when environment variables are being "injected" into the application. Sometimes it is done during the image build and other times it is done during runtime.

#### Sample `.env` file for local testing

The frontent application will be available at localhost:8100 

```bash
TYPESENSE_API_KEY=
TYPESENSE_HOST=localhost
TYPESENSE_UPSTREAM_HOST=typesense
TYPESENSE_FETCHER_HOST=nginx
TYPESENSE_FETCHER_PORT=80
TYPESENSE_FETCHER_PROTOCOL=http
TYPESENSE_FETCHER_PATH="/api"
TYPESENSE_PORT=8100
TYPESENSE_PROTOCOL=http
TYPESENSE_PATH="/api"

```

#### Indicative `.env` file for deployment to AWH

This respects the convention that AWH sidecar applications are all exposed as `localhost`, rather than at their own hostnames (as works for local Docker compose) 

```bash
TYPESENSE_API_KEY=
TYPESENSE_HOST=
TYPESENSE_UPSTREAM_HOST=localhost
TYPESENSE_FETCHER_HOST=localhost
TYPESENSE_PORT=80
TYPESENSE_PROTOCOL=https
TYPESENSE_PATH="/api"
```

## Design

There are three services defined in compose.yml:

- `nginx`
- `python-fetcher`
- `typesense`

`nginx` hosts the frontend and reverse proxies `/api` to `/` in `typesense`. 

The frontend served by `nginx` needs to have an API key to authenticate requests to `typesense` (which also needs to know this API key when launched). This is all arranged in the relevant Dockerfiles, and uses key-value pairs set in `.env` (which is not checked into source control). 

`typesense` is the database and is available over HTTP within the docker network `alpha` (this network name is largely irrelevant for now).

`python-fetcher` retrieves the data, post-processes it and inserts it into the running Typesense instance. It deletes any existing collections before doing so.

### Notes for deployment to AWH

There are some things to note before deployment to AHW given the "sidecar" pattern:

- `fetcher/fetcher.py` assumes that the database (Typesense) is available at `nginx` (hard-coded for the moment)
- `frontend` assumes that the database API is available at `${TYPESENSE_HOST}:${TYPESENSE_PORT}` under `${TYPESENSE_PATH}` (typically `/api`)
- `nginx` assumes that `typesense` makes its HTTP API available at on `$TYPESENSE_UPSTREAM_HOST}` at port 8081, which is referenced in `nginx.conf`
    - This implies that `TYPESENSE_UPSTREAM_HOST` needs changing when deploying to AHW
